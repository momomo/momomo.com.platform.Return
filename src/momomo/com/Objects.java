/**
 * This class and its inner classes are made to support any method to return more than one instance, statically and retain types and what not. 
 * 
 * Using these classes a method can simply return 1-9 return values, or declare any Object with 1-9 sub objects.
 * 
 * We know {@link java.util.Objects} is already taken but that class is used rarely why we felt it was ok, to superseed it.
 * 
 * Previously, we've experimented with class names such as Return, Chunks, Crumbs, Bits, Particles, and so forth, but nothing quite did it as return Objects.Three<>(). 
 * 
 * Objects.Three is also acceptible to use when you wish to declare three objects in one as well, where
 * 
 * Objects.Three<> three = new Objects.Three<>(); 
 *      is nice to read, while
 * Return.Three<> three = new Return.Three<>(); 
 *           not so much. 
 * 
 * Note, that fields are intentionally not final, since we might desire to generate the returns not in one place, the constructor, but might prepare it using if else logic.
 *
